Fattural (Factur-x As Training daTa for neURAL networks)
aims at providing tools and procedures to generate or provide open
training data for Open-Source neural invoice recognition.

Training data can be [essential](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07403.pdf) 
for neural networks and is available in hybrid invoices like Factur-X.

The first procedure is a combination of [Corpus](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/corpus/),
[Mustang](https://mustangproject.org), 
XSLT and a [open source neural invoice recogition](https://github.com/naiveHobo/InvoiceNet)
